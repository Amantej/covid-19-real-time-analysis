### Introduction

Coronavirus is a continuing worldwide pandemic, which has affected a lot of people in one way or other. Inorder to decline or reduce the effects/spread of this virus, we have to understand the trends across a specific area. In this project we try to understand the patterns of Covid effects and spread by using US county level covid data with additional/supporting enrichment data. By performing some analysis, we will come up with certain observations/inputs which might be helpful to reduce the covid spread curve. 

#### Who are we :

Aman Tej Vidapu, Amantejv - Graduate Student <br>
Saipavan Tadikonda, saipavantadikonda - Graduate Student <br>
Viveka Erram, vivekareddy - Graduate Student <br>
Lahari Chilakuri, lchilakuri - Graduate Student <br>
Varsha Veeramaneni, VarshaRaoV - Graduate Student <br>

### Project Aim
We plan to analyze the covid-19 data with certain enrichment datasets in order to gain useful insights. We also want to create models that can estimate the amount of covid-19 cases and deaths throughout the various counties in the United States of America, and then show that information alongside facts and statistics on a dashboard.

### Technologies Used
The technologies used for this project are:
* Python3.
* Jupyter Notebook by Anaconda.
* Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.

### Setup
* For installing Anaconda (for jupyter notebook): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
* For libraries: conda install -c anaconda pandas, conda install -c anaconda numpy, conda install -c anaconda matplotlib.
* Next open cmd or terminal, clone this repository by using - git clone "https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/Spring-22_COVID-Team_3.git".
* As we used relative pathing we are good to run this code in your local.
